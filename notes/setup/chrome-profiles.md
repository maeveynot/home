# Personal notes for initializing Chrome profiles

There doesn't seem to be a way to automate this, so here's a list of
steps I want to follow every time I create a new profile in Google
Chrome or Chromium.

## Settings

 1. Change search engine to DuckDuckGo
 2. Set startup tab state to "where you left off"
 3. Expand "advanced" settings
 4. Turn off prediction services
 5. Turn on DNT
 6. Go into autofill and turn it off
 7. Go into password management and turn it off
 8. Turn off background apps

## Web Store

 1. Blank New Tab Page (hide the toolbar icon)
 2. Vanilla Cookie Manager
 3. OneTab
 4. uBlock Origin
