# If vipe reopens stdout to /dev/tty, emacsclient fails, and sometimes
# crashes emacs. It seems like this is Linux-specific:
#
# https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-26.3/src/term.c#L3988
#
# Allow using `export TTY=$(tty)` in shell init as a workaround.

test -n "$TTY" && exec <"$TTY" >"$TTY"
exec emacsclient -t -c -a '' "$@"
